-----------------------

Requirement: Perform inference on cctv feed, get detections/annotations etc and save or directly show detected/annotated stream on frontend. No need to do the logic of showing detections on UI on frontend code, It will be done in backend itself, we will only use frontend to show the processed feed as per the application.

Rename Helmet Detection application to Face detection.

Scenario I want: I land on page nothing is invoked its simple dashboard with options to turn on application and cameras.
I select applciation 1 in this case Helmet detection(rename this to face det) it will have 3 camera in which camera 1 is using real rtsp url for the feed and rest of the 2 are placeholders, Only show camera 1 maximized when application 1 is clicked, other 2 cameras can be invoked or closed. It must seem like Showing real feed on UI but we are first processing it and then showing on the UI, if person is found and detected the annotated feed(bounding box on faces) with be shown on UI if no face is detected the boxes wont be drawn on the feed.

Read the codebase to Work with this Update.
Research on web etc using perplexity mcp.
and give me a robust plan.
